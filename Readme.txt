Please enforce that "Challenge Words" are only to be embarked on with someone else.

"Challenge words" should be chosen carefully with the senior's safety in mind. 

NOTE: "Challenge Word", when referenced, refers to a word that the senior would
have to go out into the world to find and take a photo of. Words inputted below
the "Challenge Word" indicator in the Generator are interpreted to be "Challenge
Words" by the Module, and will be reflected in the generation of PDFs.
